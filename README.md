# Prediction Market

## Project Description

The Prediction Market is a decentralized smart contract platform built on the Core Testnet that enables users to create, participate in, and resolve prediction markets. Users can bet on the outcomes of future events with cryptocurrency, creating a transparent and trustless betting environment. The platform allows market creators to pose questions about future events, while participants can place bets on their predicted outcomes and claim winnings if their predictions are correct.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a fully decentralized prediction market ecosystem that democratizes access to forecasting and betting on future events. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate intermediaries, ensure transparency, and provide fair and automated resolution of prediction markets. The platform serves as a foundation for collective intelligence gathering, where crowd wisdom can be harnessed to predict future outcomes across various domains including sports, politics, economics, and technology.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd prediction-market
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and other configurations
```

4. Compile the smart contracts:
```bash
npm run compile
```

5. Deploy to Core Testnet:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Usage

**Creating a Market:**
```javascript
await predictionMarket.createMarket(
  "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by end of 2024?",
  ["Yes", "No"],
  7 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 7 days
);
```

**Placing a Bet:**
```javascript
await predictionMarket.placeBet(marketId, optionIndex, {
  value: ethers.parseEther("0.1")
});
```

**Claiming Winnings:**
```javascript
await predictionMarket.claimWinnings(marketId);
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

The main contract (`Project.sol`) includes three core functions:

1. **createMarket()** - Allows users to create new prediction markets
2. **placeBet()** - Enables users to place bets on market outcomes
3. **claimWinnings()** - Allows winners to claim their rewards after resolution

## Network Configuration

- **Network**: Core Testnet
- **RPC URL**: https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
- **Chain ID**: 1115
- **Block Explorer**: https://scan.test2.btcs.network

## Testing
